# Plagiarism Detection

I completed this project as part of my Udacity Machine-Learning Nanodegree.
In this project I developed a plagiarism detector, which performs a binary classification based on artificial intelligence, depending on how similar the given answer text is to the source text.

The tasks as well as the solution path I chose is stored in the respective Jupyter notebooks.
Additionally, there are some smaller Python scripts with help functionality in the repository.

## Notebook 1: Data Exploration
- Readin, visualize and getting familiar with the text data provided by Udacity.
- Exploration of the data, quantity ratios and data features

## Notebook 2: Feature Engineering
- Cleaning and preparing the data
- Defining features for comparing answer text and source texts
- Selecting meaningful features and detecting correlation between features
- Prepare training and test data as CSV file - with the respective features and data points

## Notebook 3: Training a Model
- Creating the AI model
- Upload the data to Amazon-S3
- Train and deploying the model using AWS-Sagemaker
- Evaluate and optimize the result model
